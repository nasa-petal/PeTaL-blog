From this stems biomimetics, an interdisciplinary design method that strives to emulate how organisms tackle fundamental problems in engineering. Bridging the gap between biological systems and human technology has incentivized a bottom-up approach for biologically inspired design that focuses on the principles of biomimicry and biomimetics.
